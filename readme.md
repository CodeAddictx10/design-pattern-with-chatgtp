# **My Chatgtp Prompt response for SOLID principles and Design Patterns**

This repo contains ChatGPT's responses to prompts on SOLID principles and Design Patterns. The responses are written in Markdown and include code snippets in TypeScript and PHP.

So, it might not make total sense to you. But I hope you find it useful.

I would recommend you to check out this book: **DIVE INTO DESIGN PATTERNS** by Alexander Shvets. It's a great resource to learn about design patterns.
